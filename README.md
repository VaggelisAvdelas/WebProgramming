# Web Programming

Final Examination Exercise for the 4th semester course, Web Programming, University of Piraeus.
The exercise asked us to develop a website for patients, and doctors. Patients had the ability to book an appointment, cancel an appointment, view their info and their appointments. Doctors had the ability to view their appointments, plan which days the accept appointments and cancel their appointments. Finally, there was an admin that could log in the system to add more doctors or new patients. People had the ability to either register or log in with their credentials.
I used PostgreSQL as the database where data was stored. Passwords were encrypted(Hash and Salt) inside the database.

Exercise was graded 9/10 due to some minor bugs which were later fixed.
